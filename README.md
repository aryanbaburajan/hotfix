![hotfix](./banner.png)

i've been on the internet for the majority of my life at this point. so, i wrote a chrome extension to fix the shortcomings of various applications and websites.

features:  
\- download webp images as png or jpg  
\- hide the "1 blocked messages" label on discord  
\- embed turbowarp for scratch.mit.edu projects  
\- show the full tweet content in the same page, on clicking "show more"  
\- rename 'X' to 'Twitter' for those who prefer that  
\- bring back YouTube's dislike counter  
\- a "play all" button for a playlist of all the videos uploaded on a channel

and much more coming!

is there anything that irks you on a website? [open an issue for them](https://github.com/aryanbaburajan/hotpix).
