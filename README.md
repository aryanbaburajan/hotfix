after having been on the internet for a whole decade now, i'd noticed a lot flaws of various applications and websites. so, i wrote a chrome extension to fix them.

features:  
\- download webp images as png or jpg  
\- hide the "1 blocked messages" label on discord  
\- embed turbowarp for scratch.mit.edu projects  
\- show the full tweet content in the same page, on clicking "show more"  
\- rename 'X' to 'Twitter' for those who prefer that  
\- bring back YouTube's dislike counter  
\- a "play all" button for a playlist of all the videos uploaded on a channel

and much more coming!

is there anything that irks you on a website? [open an issue](https://github.com/aryanbaburajan/hotfix/issues).
